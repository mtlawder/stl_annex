                  In 2019, St. Louis-Lambert International Airport saw 15M passengers travel through its gates. Those passengers flew on 53 thousand different flights served by 9 airlines regularly serving the airport with direct flights to 56 domestic destination. Last year in 2020 passengers, flights, and routes all dropped due to the pandemic. And while passengers in 2021 will remain well below overall 2019 statistics at some point travelers will return in larger numbers. There is no guarantee that as airlines rebuild their route map from STL that it will look the same as it did in 2019, but once flights from STL are back to near 2019 levels, I want to look at where STL can expand going forward. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are three different types of expansion we will look at:
                  1. New non-stop destinations
                  2. More frequency on existing routes
                  3. Larger planes on existing flights
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'll start with new non-stop destination options, but before we look at the future possibilities let's look at several recent route expansions for STL. Since 2015, several new non-stop destinations have added (I'm not including the smaller severed by regional airlines like Air Choice One). In 2016, 4 new routes were started, three serving small-medium Midwest-ish metros that didn't previously have direct service (LIT-Little Rock, DSM-Des Moines, ICT-Wichita) and one adding additional service to the Bay Area (OAK-Oakland) that was already served at SFO. In 2018, another Bay Area airport (SJO San Jose) was added along with 2 small-medium coastal metros (BDL-Hartford, SMF-Sacramento). These 7 new routes give us a good range for different types of destinations that STL might expand into and hopefully will provide some insight into possibly future lading spots for STL direct flights.

                  Norfolk - Norfolk had 3.6M O&D passengers in 2019. Of those passengers, 35% flew direct to their destination and 65% had to connect. Looking at the 2.2M who had a single connection,
