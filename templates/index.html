That trend of slowing the growth rate has continued and I put up a <a href="/coronavirus_dashboard">dashboard showcasing the statistics</a> which I've been regularly updating.

                  I put together a series of charts looking at Nation, State, and County level COVID-19 data from The New York Times. The charts show several different ways to look at the numbers of cases and deaths from the virus and they will be updated as new data becomes available.

                  There are many different news outlets and academic institutions putting out very informative data, charts, and visuals around the COVID-19 outbreak. I'm not an epidemiologist or infectious disease expert, but with so much different statistics being reported in the news, I wanted to take a look at more of the raw numbers for cases within the United States. In this blog, I'll walk through how I've looked at some of the state level data surrounding COVID-19

                  St. Louis has had slow annual growth in the total Origin & Destination (O&D) passengers that it has generated in the last 25 year. <a href="/blog_od_ranks">Last month I looked at its growth compared to other airports</a> and saw that STL has steadily declined in airport rankings for total O&D passengers.

              The projects below were built to be used to find insteresting insights from different data sets. Many data sets and tools are St. Louis centric, but some extend to information well beyond the city and county borders. I didn't create these tools in a vacuum, I also use them! You can find blog posts with analysis created using these tools (and sometimes outside analysis) at the bottom of this page. Find out more information about the <a href="/about">author here</a> and please reach out to matt@stlannex.com if you have any questions or comments about the tools or analysis.

The tool currently only offers domestic routes arriving at or departing from a limited set of airports. Additionally, there is only a limited set of mappings available to roll up regional carriers to their mainline carriers as we work to find more accurate mappings. Data currently available from Jan. 2014 to mid 2018.
