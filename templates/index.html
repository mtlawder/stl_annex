              Just like the last race redux I wrote (Queens 10k), the Bronx 10 Miler started out as half marathon. At some point I am going to have to dedicate a full post to all the different half marathons that NYRR used to put on. It seems like every race I look into was originally a half marathon! The first Bronx half was held in 1995

COVID-19 has shrunk every carrier this year, but each carrier has taken their own approach at how much and where to trim flights. In April as passenger counts reached their nadir in the US, every major airline cut at least half of its departures. Southwest had by far the least

              Travel patterns can change quickly. Airlines may spin up service to a new city. A bus route might begin between poplar spots. Rentable scooter could invade a metro seemingly overnight. But Amtrak routes stay mostly the same. In 2020, Amtrak routes look almost exactly like they did in 2005 (at least they did pre-COVID-19). Frequencies

                  People stopped flying. That's not completely true. There are still a few people flying and that number continues to grow each week. Based on <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput">numbers reported by the TSA</a> towards the end of May, they are screening close to 15% the number of passengers at US airports compared with the same time from 2019.

                  Central Park Track Club (CPTC) has been a fixture on the New York road running scene since its founding in 1972. The club consistently ranks as one of the top clubs across the city and on any given day you can spot many runners cruising through Central Park sporting the team's maple leaf logo and orange colors.

While New Jersey seems to have halted the growth of new daily cases, they have yet to see large drops in new cases like New York has been experience over the last week.

              The projects below were built to be used to find insteresting insights from different data sets. Many data sets and tools are St. Louis centric, but some extend to information well beyond the city and county borders. I didn't create these tools in a vacuum, I also use them! You can find blog posts with analysis created using these tools (and sometimes outside analysis) at the bottom of this page.

                The Airline Data Browser aggregates statistics from the Bureau of Transportation <a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?Table_ID=293">T-100 Segment </a> data set and allows users to look at information such as total departures, passengers, and load factors on individual routes down to a monthly level. The tool currently only offers domestic routes arriving at or departing from a limited set of airports. Additionally, there is only a limited set of mappings available to roll up regional carriers to their mainline carriers as we work to find more accurate mappings. Data currently available from Jan. 2014 to mid 2018.
