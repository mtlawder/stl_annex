                Central Park Track Club (CPTC) has been a fixture on the New York road running scene since its founding in 1972. The club consistently ranks as one of the top clubs across the city and on any given day you can spot many runners cruising through Central Park sporting the team's maple leaf logo and orange colors. You can read more about <a href="http://www.centralparktc.org/">the team and its history on there webpage</a>. I joined the team in early 2016 after moving to the Upper East Side and have enjoyed every moment of my time running with CPTC (well not so much the final mile during some of the hot summer races, but almost every moment).
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are not familiar with the New York running club racing scene, it's as deep and diverse as any city's club setup in the country if not the world. There are <a href="https://www.nyrr.org/getinvolved/club">91 competitive and social running clubs</a> registered with the New York Road Runners, who put on a fabulous <a href="https://results.nyrr.org/clubstandings#d=BM&m=1">series of scored club races</a>. Clubs compete in three different tiers (along with 4 different Master's age categories) with promotion and demotion among the tiers based on team results. This setup creates an engaging year round team environment unlike any I have experienced anywhere else. I will be digging in to the results (specifically the times from CPTC) for some of the more high profile scoring races and offering a high level review of the results to go along with some visualizations. I'll start with the most prominent club race of the year which takes place towards the end of July/beginning of August each year. The Club Team Championships (5 miles).

              <h4>NYRR Team Championships</h4>
              <h6>Added May 2020</h6>
              <p>
                Often referenced as just the Club Champs, this race is the pinnacle of club racing in New York. The race itself consists of a familiar 5 mile loop through Central Park and has separate races for the Men and Women with each open team scoring 10 runners deep. This race forces teams to really show their depth and while it usually does not take place during most runner's training peak, you can bet each runner is pushing hard for each position and maxing out their fitness level. I'm very fond of the normal race course because it suits my running style, with a runners having to ascend the large cat hill at about 3.5 miles into the race. It's a late enough test of strength to drop any pretenders, but those that can conquer the hill get a fast, slightly downhill final mile and with a very competitive field, you can get some fast times (as long as the weather agrees).
              </p>
              <p>
                The race has grown in size quite a bit since its first running in 1987 with 309 runners (60 of which were from CPTC) and had over 2,000 participants last year. CPTC consistently sends about 100 runners to the race each year and the team has finished at least in the top 4 clubs in the open division every year since 2010 with the Women's team winning the race in 2017 and 2018. In the Masters categories, CPTC has also had lots of recent success with the Men winning the 40+ and 60+ divisions last year. The race in general has always been one of the more competitive races. Since the race's inception the top Men have run many sub 25 minute races with the average time of the top 10 Men usually in the mid to high 24 minute range. The Women's race historically has been fast as well. Over the last 15 races, 11 times the Women's average time for the top ten places has been in the 28's (and once even under 28 minutes). The chart below shows the average times for the top ten runners from every year.

              <p>
                CPTC's times have mirrored the general race (albeit a little bit slower) and with most of the team's top runners toeing the start line, the team has seen consistently fast results since the race's inception. The Men's times fluctuate from year to year but consistently averaged in the 26 minute range with a few years in the 27's. The women's times have shown a downward trend as CPTC has closed the gap between its top racers and the field. While the women never averaged below 31:45 as a team prior to 2005, in 6 of the last 7 years the team has averaged 31 minutes or under.

            <h4>Queens 10k (previously Half Marathon)</h4>
            <h6>Added July 27, 2020</h6>
            <p>
              While the previous race discussed, the Club Champs, has remained very similar for 30+ years in distance and times, the Queens 10k has changed quite a lot, adjusting its date and distance frequently. The race that has become the Queens 10k, began in 1994 as a Half Marathon in April (Brooklyn was in March at the time) on a course in College Pointe. If anyone knows the exact route from back then, let me know, but I did find a <a href="https://www.halfmarathons.net/usa_half_marathons_new_york_nyrr_half_marathon_queens.html"> description of the Half course from the 2011 event here</a>. The race moved to May for the 2003-2005 editions before switching to September in 2007 and to July (that must've been fun in the heat) in 2010. After 18 years as a Half Marathon, the race switched to a 10k event in 2012. In 2014, the race moved to it's current timing in June and although a 5k event was added for one year in 2016, the event remains a 10k that loops around Flushing Meadows Corona Park.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the distance and time of year moving about so much (along with it not being a points race until recently), CPTC did not have large numbers at the race until the last three years which had over 60 CPTC'er racing each year. I ran the race for the first (and so far only time) in 2018. I really enjoyed the course which offers a much flatter (and a bit more winding) alternative to common Central Park loop. The largest "hills" are really just over passes that loop over some of the roads and there are nice long stretches where you can really open up your stride (or fall asleep if you're are not careful). Living in Manhattan in 2018, non-Central Park or Manhattan races provided a great opportunity for me to explore some areas of the city that I did not get to as frequently. Corona Park is really a lovely place to run with criss crossing paths and flat open terrain. The one caveat keeping Queens 10k from being a blazing fast race, it that it is often running in blazing heat or humidity towards the end of June. Additionally, the timing of the race often comes when runners are not at peak fitness. Many year round runners have had a spring season with a peak race in April or May and haven't necessarily ramped back up to 100%. The upside of the timing is if you had a rough spring or are looking to extend your fitness into the summer, Queens offers an opportunity to finisher higher place-wise than you might in other races (as long as you can handle the heat). Although that is becoming less of the case as the race rises in popularity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even with the less than ideal timing, the race has grown dramatically since becoming a 10k in 2012. That year 5,460 runners completed the race and by 2019 that had more than doubled to 11,853. And while this year there were zero participants due to COVID, I would not be surprised to see the event grow larger since the open space and roadways of Flushing Meadows and Corona Park should be able to hold more participants. The race itself has gotten faster as it has expanded. In 2017, the race replaced two other June races (Retro 4M and LGBT Pride 5M) in the NYRR Club Series and times at the front of the race have dropped quickly since that shift. The 100th place finisher in 2012 ran 41:38 and in 2019 that had dropped to 36:11. That 36:11 would have placed you in the top 20 each year from 2012-2015, so the Club points is definitely creating a much more competitive race at the front.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the race has only counted for points recently, CPTC has had solid showings at the race this decade. NYRR only scored three teams (and no age-based teams) pre 2016 (since it wasn't a Club race). The Women's Open team did not crack the top three until 2018 they took 2nd, but followed that up with a 3rd place finish in 2019. The Men's Open team has finished either 2nd or 3rd in 2012-2015 & 2017-2018, but neither team has broken through with a win. The Master's teams have been more successful with the Women's 40+ and 70+ winning in 2019 and the Men's 50+ team winning in both 2018 & 2019.

              During its early years as a Half, the Queens race had some reasonably quick times often requiring sub 70 minute mens and sub 80 minute womens times to be competing for a win. The fastest winning time was in 2001 when Paul Mwangi went 66:32. But the times slowly crept upwards and once the race moved into the heat of the summer, the paces really slowed with only 7 runners under the 80 minute threshold in each year. To be fair the weather for the 2011 race was 77 degrees with 60% humidity and in 2010 was 85(!) degrees with 63% humidity. Congrats to brave 3,688 runners finishing that year and Michael Dixon (73:59) from Fanwood, NJ (my wife's hometown!) and Reilly Kiernan (83:24) for powering through to victories. In my opinion the NYRR made the right call moving to a 10k. I love a good half marathon, but save the longer distances for the fall and spring. One other interesting tidbit from the winning times over the years is that for three straight years (2005, 2006, and 2007) the race was won with the exact same time 69:29. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After steady attendance in the 30 participant range for Central Park during the race's early 2000's editions, the numbers trailed off as the times slowed and the race moved into the the heart of summer. CPTC racers always looking for opportunities to run fast only sent 4 racers in 2009, 10 in 2010, and 15 2011. But racers returned once the race became a more palatable 10k and especially after it became a points race. Since the 10k is less than a decade old and has only drawn the fastest runners in the last couple of years, the CPTC leaderboard is not as deep as some other NYRR races, but I suspect that fast times will continue to be added in the near future. For now Veronica Jackson's 35:56 (2018) and Ben Toomer's 30:59 from last year are the top CPTC 10k times at the race. Check out the Top 10 all time leaderboard in the charts below and dig into more of the individual CPTC team results at this event in the Dashboard.
